This repository contains tasks relating to preprocessor in C language. The preprocessor is a program that processes the source code before it is passed to the compiler. It can perform various operations such as including header files, defining macros, conditional compilation and file inclusion. The tasks in this repository are designed to help you learn and practice the use of preprocessor directives and features in C. You will find tasks on topics such as:

- How to use #include and #define directives
- How to create and invoke macros with arguments
- How to use #if, #elif, #else and #endif directives for conditional compilation
- How to use #ifdef and #ifndef directives for testing macro definitions
- How to use predefined macros such as __FILE__, __LINE__ and __DATE__
- How to create header files and guard them against multiple inclusion

Each task has a description, an example and a main.c file that you can compile and run to test your code. You can also check your code style with betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl scripts provided in the repository. Please read the README.md file for more information on how to use this repository.

TASK ZERO
Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.

TASK ONE
Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359

TASK TWO
Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.
    You are allowed to use the standard library

TASK THREE
Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.

TASK FOUR
Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
